Most models in ADTests are run with 1 thread. This model is run with 4 threads
to properly demonstrate the compatibility with multithreaded observe
statements. See the docs for more details on multithreading in Turing:

@model function multithreaded(x)
    a ~ Normal()
    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(x)
        x[i] ~ Normal(a)
    end
end

x = randn(100)
model = setthreadsafe(multithreaded(x), true)
